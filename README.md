### Project Description
A website to detect the sound of a dog barking and displying some creative and funny commands as reply

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Dogs bark all the time, but what are they really trying to say? Are they warning us of impending doom... or just hungry again? For centuries, humans have struggled to decode the mysterious woofs and ruffs of our four-legged companions. We decided it‚Äôs time to stop guessing and start translating.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a Dog Bark Translator ‚Äì a groundbreaking, scientifically questionable, completely unnecessary web app that listens to barks and translates them into ridiculous, randomly generated messages.
